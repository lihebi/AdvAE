#+TITLE: Visual Defense
* Ideas

How to produce image that not looking awkward to human? Consider the
sunglass paper. Adding a sunglass will not make us feel awkward. So
the key is, to compute the image that comply with noise.

* Install
Clone https://github.com/carlini/nn_robust_attacks into
=~/github/reading/nn_robust_attacks= (and modify the python path in
the code).

python packages
- tensorflow-gpu
- keras
- cleverhans
- foolbox

* Implementation

1. I should have a CNN model. Probably a baseline model for mnist first.
2. I will add my loss term, the gradient of Z w.r.t. x
3. see if this CNN still works

4. plug in FGSM and CW-L2

** STARTED accuracy 

Now I would like to run an attack with bounded allowed distortion, and
calculate the accuracy of my defense. The attacks:

- [ ] FGSM
- [ ] iFGSM
- [ ] CW (it does not have a bound). I have to decide which
  implementation of CW to use

I need to compare the performance with other defenses:
- [ ] iterative adv training with PGD attack
- [X] l2 input gradient regularizer 

I need to run on the following dataset:
- [X] mnist
- [ ] cifar
- [ ] imagenet  

** TODO checkpoint
I need checkpoint to reduce experiment time

** available implementation references

** TODO define a lasso that sets the gradients to 0 when lower than a threshold

#+TITLE: Implementation notes

This attempts to clean up previous tf1 implmenetation, and try to figure out
what's the root cause of performance difference.


* using only adv data

It works, but very tricky. You have to use lr=1e-4, not 1e-3. Or, you can use
1e-3, by first run an epoch of nat+adv, then solo adv.

* Previous advae

How that achieves 90% adv acc in one epoch?

* TODO-list

** custom train loop
*** test matching previous performance
*** tensorboard
** advae test
** free train
** dynamic data mixing
** dynamic attacking strength

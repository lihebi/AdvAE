ProgressMeter.jl https://github.com/timholy/ProgressMeter.jl

Very easy to use:

#+BEGIN_SRC julia
@showprogress 1 "Computing..." for i in 1:50
    sleep(0.1)
end
#+END_SRC

** TODO CIFAR10 models
*** data augmentation
*** ResNet
*** VGG

** ResNet models on CIFAR
*** batchnorm layer
*** VGG DenseNet
*** the Metalhead models

https://github.com/FluxML/Metalhead.jl/tree/master/src


- VGG: the VGG in flux-model-zoo is not working due to batch norm
  layer error on CuArrays
- ResNet
- DenseNet

However, these net seems to be for ImageNet, and does not seem to
provide good interface for customize. I would read and understand them
and adapt for my use.

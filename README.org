#+TITLE: Adversarially trained auto-encoders

We propose to *iteratively* adversarially train an *external* auto-encoder to
protect a vulnerable base classifier.

The algorithm is implemented in four frameworks, source code can be found in the
following folders:

- [[file:tf1][tf1]]: using tensorflow v1 framework, most complete implementation
- [[file:tf2][tf2]]: using tensorflow v2
- [[file:pytorch][pytorch]]: using pytorch
- [[file:julia][julia]]: using Julia and Flux, best code quality, recommanded
